        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>To harness the cognitive surplus of the tech community towards building solutions to real problems in the world.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>We are a group of software developers from Vancouver, BC, Canada with socially progressive ideals who have come together in an effort to help others. We each come from different backgrounds and our unique experiences have given us inside knowledge of social issues. We talked for a year about how we wanted to do a project together, all the while also talking about world issues. One day we put our passions together and CodeDoesGood was born.</p>

        <p>Our first project was a list of lawyers for refugees and families and sponsors of refugees detained at airports as part of the US Government's executive order (also known as "The Muslim Ban"). One Sunday one of us approached the group with the idea and within 3 days a list was published and the names were being populated.</p>

        <p>In addition to our umbrella goal of building solutions to real problems in the world, our goals going forward are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>to provide an avenue for new developers to be mentored,</li>
          <li>to provide a way for nonprofits to get software inexpensively, and</li>
          <li>to set an example for how distributed authority / decision-making can work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Join Us</h3>
        <p>We are seeking developers of like mind to join us. All levels welcome, the main requirements are a desire to teach, an openness to learn, a compassionate desire to do good in the world, and free time. Our organization is volunteer-run and we welcome developers from anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>We'd love to hear also from designers, experienced marketers, legal aides, other non-profits, other professionals and basically anyone who would like to lend a hand. We are in the process of becoming a federally registered NPO (Non-Profit Organization) in Canada.</p>
